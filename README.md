## Software Development in Music

I particularuly love the recent developments in making coding accessible to musicians [This](https://riemannkollektion.com/blogs/techno-producer-knowledge-hub/max-for-live-the-techno-producers-guide) is an article that dives into one of the most popular coding environments for musicians, which is called Max for Live.

I like that this article gives a bit of a background to what Max is, and why it is important for musicians to know that it exists! What is especially cool is how the interface for Max is purposely similar to how one would patch cables into an analog synth. I think the fact that Max is a visual coding environment is especially important for artists.
